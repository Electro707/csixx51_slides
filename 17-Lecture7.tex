\section{Modules}

\begin{frame}{Expanding Python}
  While the built-in Python functions and what you can do might be fine for some applications, what if you want to expand the functionality of you application?

  For example, what if you need to get the factorial of a number? Sure, you can make a function, but does it already exist?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modules}
  The answer is with Modules. Modules are python files or packages than can be imported into your application.

  A Package is just a collection of modules. All packages are modules, not all modules are packages.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Importing}
  Say you have a two python files: \verb|main.py| and \verb|config.py|. From main, you can import config with the import statement:

  \begin{minted}[breaklines=true,frame=single]{python}
import config
  \end{minted}

  \verb|config| is now imported as an object containing all functions, classes, and variables from \verb|config.py|
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Import statement}
  The full syntax for import is \mintinline{python}{import MODULE as NAME} or \mintinline{python}{from MODULE import IDENTIFIER as NAME}.

  \verb|from| is used if you want to import something from a module, for example \mintinline{python}{from random import randint}.

  The usage of \verb|as| is optional, and simply renames what you import, for example \mintinline{python}{import numpy as np}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Import ALL}
  From a module, you can import so that every namespace is directly available in your application, for example

  \begin{minted}[breaklines=true,frame=single]{python}
from math import *
print(pi)   # Is now in our local namespace
  \end{minted}

  % lol, from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2360724/what-exactly-does-import-import
  This is generally not the best idea for multiple reasons: Namespace collision and inefficient for big packages.

  Generally, it is better to explicitly import what you need, in the case above
    \begin{minted}[breaklines=true,frame=single]{python}
from math import pi
print(pi)   # Is now in our local namespace..again
  \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Import search}
  The import function searches the following places for modules:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The current directory
    \item sys.path
  \end{itemize}

  sys.path is initialized automatically by Python, and has the following directories added (as over simplification):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Everything in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, if it exists
    \item Standard modules that comes with Python
    \item Site packages
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Standard Modules}
  Python has a LOT of standard modules that it comes with.

  They can be found in \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{Site Packages}
  You can download external modules and install them into your site packages directory.

  This process is done with a built-in tool called \verb|pip|.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]{PIP}
  pip is a tool to allow to install site packages. You can either download the "compressed" package (in a wheel format) and install it with
  \begin{minted}[breaklines=true,frame=single]{bash}
  pip install DOWNLOADED.whl
  \end{minted}

  Or you can have pip automatically download the module for you! The available modules can be found at \url{https://pypi.org/}. The download syntax is the same, for example
  \begin{minted}[breaklines=true,frame=single]{bash}
  pip install numpy
  \end{minted}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[standout]{End}
  The end
\end{frame}
