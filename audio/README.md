# Audio files

To build Lecture #11, I have included a fun little audio. I cannot include that in this repository.

To download it, I ran the following commands

```
yt-dlp  --extract-audio --audio-format aif --prefer-ffmpeg  'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DlROhT8NgU'

ffmpeg -i AMOGUS\ \[5DlROhT8NgU\].mp3 -ar 44100 AMONG-US.aif
```

The file was then placed in this folder.
